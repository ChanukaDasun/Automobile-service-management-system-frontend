## üîå Backend API Endpoints Required

You need to implement these endpoints in your backend:

### Client Endpoints
```
GET  /api/appointments/daily-limit?date=YYYY-MM-DD
     Response: { date, totalAppointments, maxAppointments, canBookMore, vehicleLimits }

GET  /api/appointments/available-slots?date=YYYY-MM-DD&vehicleType=car
     Response: [{ time, available, remainingSlots }]

POST /api/appointments
     Body: { vehicleType, date, timeSlot, serviceType, description }
     Response: Appointment object
```

### Admin Endpoints
```
GET   /api/appointments?date=YYYY-MM-DD
      Response: Appointment[]

PATCH /api/appointments/:id/assign
      Body: { employeeId, employeeName }
      Response: Updated Appointment
```

### Employee Endpoints
```
GET   /api/appointments/employee/:employeeId
      Response: Appointment[]

PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status
      Body: { status: 'in-progress' | 'completed' }
      Response: Updated Appointment
```

---

## üîß Configuration Steps

### 1. Update Environment Variables

Create or update `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 2. Update App.tsx Routes

Add these routes to your `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import ClientAppointments from './pages/ClientAppointments';
import AdminAppointments from './pages/AdminAppointments';
import EmployeeTasks from './pages/EmployeeTasks';

// In your routes:
<Route path="/appointments" element={<ClientAppointments />} />
<Route path="/admin/appointments" element={<AdminAppointments />} />
<Route path="/employee/tasks" element={<EmployeeTasks />} />
```

### 3. Update Navigation (Navbar.tsx)

Add navigation links based on user role:

```tsx
import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function Navbar() {
  const { user } = useUser();
  const role = user?.publicMetadata?.role;

  return (
    <nav>
      {role === 'user' && (
        <Link to="/appointments">My Appointments</Link>
      )}
      {role === 'admin' && (
        <Link to="/admin/appointments">Manage Appointments</Link>
      )}
      {role === 'employee' && (
        <Link to="/employee/tasks">My Tasks</Link>
      )}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

## üé® Business Logic Details

### Daily Limits

The system enforces two types of limits:

1. **Global Daily Limit**: Total appointments per day (e.g., 50)
2. **Vehicle-Type Limits**: Per vehicle type per day (e.g., 20 cars, 10 trucks)

Example daily limit response:
```json
{
  "date": "2025-11-05",
  "totalAppointments": 35,
  "maxAppointments": 50,
  "canBookMore": true,
  "vehicleLimits": {
    "car": { "current": 15, "max": 20, "available": true },
    "truck": { "current": 8, "max": 10, "available": true },
    "suv": { "current": 12, "max": 15, "available": true }
  }
}
```

### Time Slots

Generate time slots in your backend (example):
```javascript
// 9 AM to 5 PM, 1-hour slots
const timeSlots = [
  "09:00-10:00", "10:00-11:00", "11:00-12:00",
  "12:00-13:00", "13:00-14:00", "14:00-15:00",
  "15:00-16:00", "16:00-17:00"
];
```

For each slot, calculate:
- Total bookings for that slot
- Available slots remaining (e.g., 3 appointments per slot)
- Filter by vehicle type

### Appointment Status Flow

```
pending ‚Üí assigned ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed
              ‚Üì
          cancelled
```

- **pending**: Just created, no employee assigned
- **assigned**: Admin assigned an employee
- **in-progress**: Employee started work
- **completed**: Service finished
- **cancelled**: Appointment cancelled

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

The system uses Clerk for authentication. Make sure:

1. **Token Management**: Update `src/lib/api.ts` to get the Clerk token correctly:

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

// In your component:
const { getToken } = useAuth();
const token = await getToken();
```

2. **Backend Validation**: Verify JWT tokens in your backend endpoints

3. **Role-Based Access**: Each endpoint should validate user roles

  user_email VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  vehicle_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  time_slot VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  service_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  assigned_employee_id VARCHAR,
  assigned_employee_name VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_date ON appointments(date);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_employee ON appointments(assigned_employee_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_user ON appointments(user_id);
```
